    <h1>Technology is Amazing!!!</h1>
    <h2>Computer Programming and Website Design is Interesting and Fun</h2>
    <p>
        I am learning HTML from <a href="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAcpAAAAJDA2ZmUwYTI4LWYwZGEtNDEzMS1iMWU3LWUxOGY3MmMwYTY5Mg.jpg">Ms. Smith</a> the coolest teacher I know! She is the director of the <a href="https://www.tagedonline.org/programs/exploring-stem-careers-pipeline-program/"> Pipeline Program at TAG Ed </a> - it's an awesome way to learn more about STEM.
    </p>
    <h3>I have learned many things.</h3>
    <p>
        I now have an overview of HTML and how it plays a huge role in websites.  I have looked at opening and closing tags, head, title and body tags, header tags, how to make links, and how to include images in my pages! I can now build a website if I had more free time and a break from school. Ms. Smith's Tag-Ed class is very fun and innovative.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am tired from school and have a lot of work to do, but creating websites if always fun and I enjoy it as a hobby.
    </p>
    <h2>I can't wait to learn more in CSS to make my website look more designed!</h2>
    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will be of great use when learning to lay out and format the look of my web page.  I am looking forward to learning this and many other things as I continue in the Exploring STEM Careers Pipeline Program!
